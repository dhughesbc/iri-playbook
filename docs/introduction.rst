Introduction
************

The iri-playbook is a full fledged IOTA node installer including monitoring and operational tools to manage an IRI node.

.. note::

  The playbook installation provides a handy tool to help manage the full node's services:

I am hoping this tutorial, together with the installer  will come in handy for those who posses less or almost no skills with Linux. And indeed, this tutorial focuses on Linux -- as suggested by many other tutorials (and justifiably), Linux is the best way to go.

I found that many tutorials lack some basic system configuration and explanations thereof. For example, running IRI as an unprivileged user, configuring firewalls, connecting to the note remotely and so on.

A copy-paste tutorial is awesome, and as it so often happens, the user can miss on some basic technical explanation about the setup. While it is impossible to
include a crash-course of Linux for the purpose of this tutorial, I will try to explain some basic concepts where I find that many users had troubles with.


Feel free to comment, create issues or contact me on IOTA's Discord chat application (nuriel77) for advice and information.

Good luck!
